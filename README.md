iTunes Info
===========

Get the current track that is playing in iTunes and display it as text. This is best used in conjunction with Geektool so that the current song information can be displayed on your desktop. There is also some basic calculation on how much you actually like the current song playing. This is done purely based on play counts vs skip counts. At the bottom, the five star rating is displayed in stars.

The purpose of adding calculation was to aid in assigning stars if it is your first time rating the song. If you don't really like a song at that moment but tend to like it overall, you may think twice about giving it a 1 star rating if how you feel right now towards that song is unusual.
